# IntentFilter_Example
An example of how important the IntentFilter class. Not as important as the Activity class, View, and R Intent, 
but very useful for several sistuações that most likely you will find yourself in Android development.

Note the importance of DEFAULT category if you have just defined an action or also set your custom category. 
It is noteworthy that the present IntentFilter the scope of activities and not in the general scope that also cover 
BroadcastReceiver ... because these are matters that should be addressed in separate posts because of the importance and 
complexity of these classes.
